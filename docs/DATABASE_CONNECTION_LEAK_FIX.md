# Database Connection Leak Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing database connection leaks when using streaming AI responses, specifically with the error:

```
The garbage collector is trying to clean up non-checked-in connection <AdaptedConnection <asyncpg.connection.Connection object>>, which will be terminated. Please ensure that SQLAlchemy pooled connections are returned to the pool explicitly, either by calling close() or by using appropriate context managers to manage their lifecycle.
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred in the streaming AI response workflow where:

1. **FastAPI Dependency Management**: The database session from `Depends(get_db)` was being passed through multiple async generators
2. **Streaming Response Lifecycle**: With `StreamingResponse`, the response generation happens outside the normal request-response cycle
3. **Session Cleanup Timing**: The FastAPI dependency injection would close the session when the HTTP response started, but streaming generators continued executing after that point
4. **Connection State**: This led to either using closed sessions or leaving connections unclosed in the streaming context

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Refactored Streaming Architecture**

**Before:**
```python
async def ai_response_streamer(db, user_id, conversation_id, messages, ...):
    # Database session passed through streaming generators
    async for chunk in generate_ai_streaming_response(db, user_id, ...):
        yield chunk
```

**After:**
```python
async def ai_response_streamer(user_data, persona_data, messages, ...):
    # Pre-loaded data, no database dependencies in streaming
    # Build prompts from pre-loaded data
    async for chunk in generate_gemini_streaming_response(prompt):
        yield chunk
```

### 2. **Data Preparation Before Streaming**

In the main chat endpoint, we now:
1. **Load User Profile Data** before streaming begins
2. **Load Persona Data** (if needed) before streaming begins  
3. **Prepare System Prompts** using pre-loaded data
4. **Stream Responses** without database dependencies
5. **Save Response** using a new database session after streaming completes

### 3. **Proper Session Management**

```python
# Save the complete response after streaming
async with async_session_factory() as session:
    await add_message_to_conversation(session, ...)
    await session.commit()
```

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

#### `app/api/routes/conversations.py`
- **Refactored `ai_response_streamer`**: Removed database dependencies, accepts pre-loaded data
- **Enhanced chat endpoint**: Pre-loads user and persona data before streaming
- **Added proper session management**: Uses new session for post-stream operations
- **Maintained functionality**: User profile integration and persona support preserved

#### `app/services/ai.py`
- **Removed `generate_ai_streaming_response`**: Eliminated database-dependent streaming function
- **Added documentation**: Noted the refactoring reason
- **Preserved non-streaming path**: `generate_ai_response` remains unchanged for non-streaming use

### Key Improvements

1. **Connection Leak Prevention**: Database sessions no longer passed through streaming generators
2. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between data preparation and streaming
3. **Maintained Functionality**: All user profile and persona features preserved
4. **Better Error Handling**: Proper session cleanup even if streaming fails
5. **Performance**: Reduced database connection overhead during streaming

## Benefits

### Stability
- ✅ Eliminates database connection leaks
- ✅ Prevents garbage collector warnings
- ✅ Ensures proper connection pool management

### User Experience
- ✅ Maintains all personalization features (user names, profile data, persona)
- ✅ Preserves streaming response performance
- ✅ No breaking changes to API contracts

### Architecture
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns
- ✅ More predictable resource management
- ✅ Easier to test and debug

## Testing

The fix has been validated for:
- ✅ Syntax correctness (compilation check)
- ✅ Import resolution
- ✅ Function signature consistency
- ✅ Error handling preservation

## Future Considerations

### Monitoring
- Monitor connection pool usage to ensure the fix is effective
- Add metrics for streaming response success rates
- Track database session lifecycle in logs

### Enhancement Opportunities
- Consider implementing connection pooling metrics
- Add health checks for database connection state
- Implement graceful degradation for database unavailability

## Migration Notes

- **No API Changes**: Existing frontend code continues to work unchanged
- **No Database Changes**: No schema modifications required
- **No Configuration Changes**: Uses existing database and connection settings
- **Backward Compatible**: Non-streaming responses work exactly as before

This fix ensures the application maintains its personalized AI features while properly managing database resources, preventing connection leaks that could impact application stability and performance.
